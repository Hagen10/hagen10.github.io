# TO-DO

### Look into doing this zoomable Raster & Vector to project a worldmap (maybe not needed)
### Look at adding planes/satelittes/weather/skies
### The twilight/solar terminator seems a bit off, not sure why. The twilight +5 degrees comes from nowhere. Need to find a source for how far away it starts from the solar terminator.
### It would be cool with a drag and measure distance between two points.
### Greenland and Antarctica is an eye sore. Please make them white or something 
### Maybe a distance bar at the bottom that changes as you zoom in?
